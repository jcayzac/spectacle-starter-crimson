# Spectacle Presentation (MDX) ðŸ‘‹

This example uses:

- `mdx`
- `@babel/preset-react` for the React components we import

Notes: These are presenter notes. This text will be automatically exported as `notes` from either your MDX file (e.g. `import {notes} from './my-file.mdx'`).

If you're editing this project directly, use the first approach. If you're using the CLI, use the second approach.
